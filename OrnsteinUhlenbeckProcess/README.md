This directory contains two simulations of the Ornstein Uhlenbeck processes done with two different methods. 

The recurrsion script uses the Euler-Maruyama methods.

The kuo script uses results from 'Introduction to Stochastic Integration' - H. Kuo and solves the stochastic differential equation directly by using Ito's Theorem.
